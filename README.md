# Parsing-from-Understat
Code to Parse data from understat.com, getting data on the EPL, Ligue 1, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and RFPL.

Some of this code is unfinished, in particular I want to try and find a way to loop over all seasons over all leagues for shot/ player data. The match data is itself something I want to eventually add to team data as well.

If there is any constructive feedback that you would like to send my way - then I would love to hear it! I am currently a student doing this in his spare time - hence the code will be functional, however it is definitely not properly optimised.

The 'Team data for every team on Understat' code was used to produced the dataset that can be found on this link: https://www.kaggle.com/jpalmer2/football-soccor-teams-stats-20142021
